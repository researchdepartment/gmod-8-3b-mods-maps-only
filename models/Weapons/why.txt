You have no idea how much trouble these few models have caused.


We needed our own player models so that the animations on human NPC's would work.

So we compiled one and it worked apart from the 357, crossbow and gravity gun. Damn.


So we messed up the player model right? 2 days working at the player model trying to get it
 to work and then realised that the game was running in HL2 mode. Not HL2DM mode. This means
 that the HL2 weapons were overriding the HL2DM models. Which we wanted to happen so that the
 NPC animations worked. The problem was that HL2DM has these few special models so the player
 animations work with them.. except we didn't know that.
 
 Oh well.
