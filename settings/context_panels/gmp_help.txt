You can now use the physgun (Blue) to move the two points. To use the 'Parent Laser to prop', aim at a prop and press the button. (Avoid picking up the start/end-points with the physgun after this!) The other settings and keys are pretty much self-explanationary. (Please note that all use of the laser menu requires cheats to be on!)"
